In this section, each player will take turns rolling to determine number, domain, and symbols for each deity in their home region.\nThese are the gods of each player's prime faction. Whether they are worshipped, feared, or ignored are up to you and they may help to spark imagination of the development and story or your world. While each player will roll up the deities of their own home region, they can be shared by everyone throughout the course of the game if needed.\nEither in the margins of your map or on a separate sheet of paper, write down your results."
